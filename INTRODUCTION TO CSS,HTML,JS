//INTRODUCTION TO CSS,HTML,JS



                                              INTRODUCTION TO CSS,HTML,JS
                                              ===========================
CSS  => Cascading Style Sheets(.css)
HTML => Hyper Text Mark-up Language(.html)
JS   => Java-Script(.js)

CSS:
====
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. 
- It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
- Used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.

HTML:
=====
- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
- Syntax :-
         <tag>content</tag>
- HISTORY:
  --------
  =>Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland invented HTML in 1991. 
  =>TIMELINE:
  -----------
  1991 - HTML 1.0(Invention)
  1993 - HTML 1.0(Released)(Not Many developers creating websites at this time)
  1995 - HTML 2.0(Released)(Contains features of HTML 1.0 + Additional New Features)
  1997 - HTML 3.0(Invented)(Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML.Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser)
  1999 - HTML 4.0(Released)(The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.)
  2014 - HTML 5.0(Released)(It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012)

JS:
===
- JavaScript is the Script Programming Language for the Web.
- JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
- Properties/Features:-
  =>Scripting/High-Level Language: JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language made for client-side execution on the browser.
  =>Interpreter Based : JavaScript is an interpreted language instead of a compiled one. 
                        In that sense, it is closer to languages like Ruby and Python. 
						The browser interprets JavaScript’s source code, line by line and runs it. 
						In contrast, a compiled language needs to be compiled into a byte-code code executable.
                        Java and C++ are examples of compiled languages.
  =>Event Handling : An event is an action or an occurrence in a system that communicates about said occurrence so that you can respond to it somehow. 
                     For example,a user clicks on a button,and the system tells you to respond to the button click event with an action,say an information box.
                     JavaScript enables you to handle events and even generate custom events.
  =>Light Weight : JavaScript isn’t a compiled language, so it doesn’t get converted to byte-code beforehand. 
                   However, it does follow a paradigm called Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation.
                   Meaning it gets converted to bytecode just as it’s about to run.
  =>Case Sensitive : JavaScript is highly case sensitive. 
                     All keywords, variables, functions names and other identifiers
  =>Control Statements : JavaScript is equipped with control statements like if-else-if, switch-case, and loops like for, while, and do-while loops. 
                         These control statements make it a powerful programming language, enabling its user to write complex logic.
  =>Objects as first-class citizens : All non-primitive data types in JavaScript are actually objects, i.e. data types like Arrays, Functions, Symbols etc. 
                                      Inherit all the properties of the Object prototype.
                                      The term first-class citizen means “being able to do what everyone else can do”. 
                                      In JavaScript Objects prototype is the base prototype of all.
  =>Functional programming(Functions as First-class citizens) : simply mean functions enjoy similar behaviour from the JavaScript interpreter as that of objects or any other variable. 
                                                                Meaning, we can pass them into arguments (pass by reference), return them by another function,
                                                                And assign them to a variable as a value.
  =>Dynamic Typing : JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. 
                     It means that the JS interpreter does not require explicit declaration of the variables before they are used. 	
                     Example:-
					 var dynamicType = “a string”;
                         dynamicType = 5;					 
  =>Platform Independent : JS can be used in any OS.
  
- VERSION HISTORY:-
  -----------------
  =>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
  =>ECMAScript(European Computer Manufacturers Association ) is the official name of the language.
  =>ECMA is a Standard in ECMA-International(nonprofit standards organization for information and communication systems)
  =>ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
  =>Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).
  =>The Original JavaScript ES1 ES2 ES3 (1997-1999)
    The Version ES4 is Never-Relaesed
    The First Main Revision ES5 (2009)
    The Second Revision ES6 (2015)
    Yearly Additions (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
